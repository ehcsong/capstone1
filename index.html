    <h1>Emily's Resume</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I'm a support team leader working in the tech industry, with experience working in start-ups and scale-ups with 40-100 employees, up to established, publicly-traded companies with globally-distributed teams of up to 1800 people.<br /> 
                After graduating with an honours degree in Journalism in 2013, I fell into a career in retail management in the beauty and wellness space, driving sales and delivering world-class customer experiences in stores with a turnover of up to £1.5 million per annum, leading teams up to 100 sales assistants and spa therapists in a mixed-use retail and spa space.<br />
                My transition into the tech industry was practically inevitable. With a father who worked in IT, I was lucky to grow up in a house where I could regularly watch computers being built up and gadgets taken apart. <br />
                My first role in tech was in a recruitment and onboarding role for a healthtech start-up, where I interviewed, processed compliance checks, and completed technical onboardings to our app and platform for carers looking for elderly care placements across the UK. <br />
                From that start, I've harnessed the skills I gained in retail management to help people more directly through technical support and customer service, and creating and delivering training plans and process improvement to drive efficiency within teams I've worked in as an individual collaborator and as a manager. <br />
